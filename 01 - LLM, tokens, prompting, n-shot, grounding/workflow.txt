Me: transcript.txt
    Hey, chat. I need you to create an elaborate blogpost using the contents of this text file, which is a transcript from one of my lectures.

AI: (The contents of README.md followed, minus the images)
    I've created a detailed blog post based on your lecture transcript. Let me know if you'd like any refinements or additional sections!

Me: Create several images based on this blogpost.

AI: Here are a few image ideas based on the blog post:

    1. Lecture Environment – A diverse group of students in a modern classroom, engaged in a discussion with an instructor presenting AI concepts on a large screen. The setting feels like an international academic environment.
    2. AI and Machine Learning Concept – A futuristic illustration depicting AI systems, neural networks, and ML algorithms analyzing data, with icons representing deep learning and automation.
    3. Large Language Models (LLMs) – A visualization of GPT-4 in action, with a chatbot interacting with users, content generation happening on a screen, and data flowing into an AI model.
    4. Python and AI Development – A programmer working on AI code in Python, with TensorFlow and PyTorch logos visible, alongside GitHub and cloud AI services like Azure and OpenAI’s API.
    5. Ethical AI Discussion – A conceptual illustration showing AI and ethics, balancing fairness, data privacy, and responsible corporate AI practices.
    6. Capstone AI Project – A futuristic AI-powered application being developed, showcasing a student working on a project involving real-world AI solutions.
  
    Would you like me to generate any specific ones first?

Me: Choose randomly, any one will do
